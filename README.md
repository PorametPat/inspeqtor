# Greeting ðŸ––

We aim to be a Data-efficient Framework for Characterization and Calibration of Quantum Device. As performing experiment and take data from the quantum device could be expensive. We would like to squeeze every drop of information from the data.

## Installation

To install `inspeqtor`, you have to pull the repository locally via

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PorametPat/inspeqtor.git
```
Using `uv`,
Then install it using
``` bash
uv add ./<PATH>
```
Or `pip` via
``` bash
pip install ./<PATH>
```
where the `<PATH>` is the path to the local `inspeqtor` repository that you cloned.
