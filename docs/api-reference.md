# API Reference

Right now the the API of `inspeqtor` is devided into `experimental` and `v2` API. The `experimental` API is relatively complete and fully function on its own. While `v2` is a new and improve API over the `experimental` API. However, `v2` is under active developement and may has to borrow some of the functionalities from the `experimental` submodule.
